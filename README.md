### Details
A web app for film aficionados to search for details of their favorite movies and find the accompanying soundtrack concurrently.

*find your film, find your soundtrack*


### General Approach
1. First project using a new framework, so it's all about **fun!**
2. Wireframing done with Figma first to visualise how the app looks, and mock user flow. 
3.  Sketching on paper of general app structure with different React components in order to get a sense of app complexity. Determine prop flow and properties needed in each individual component
4.  App skeleton is built first with responsiveness in mind using Bootstrap, leveraging the inbuilt flexbox container-column framework.

### Technologies Used
- **React:** React.js is a popular JavaScript based frontend framework that helps to simplify the building of websites by breaking down the logic and functionality into smaller components. This makes projects more reusable, modular, and dynamic. React updates the DOM through individual components so entire page refreshes are not needed to get the latest updates.
  - Note: This is my first project using React. Thank you **create-react-app**!
